        I am a fine art photographer living in Brooklyn, NY.<p></p>
            </span>
            <span class=“big”>
        My interest in photography began in Junior High School where I learned the basics of printing in a black and white darkroom. Soon after, my interest grew into a passion as I began to work with digital photography.<p>

                <p>I believe that art is the product of a vision, voice, and personal style. Art should evoke a reaction and spark a conversation. I find faults with the Institutional Theory of art and believe that a work of art must always be examined vis-à-vis the cultural climate in which it was created. The definition that art is "what artists do" is free, fluid, and flexible to change as it is applied to artists across different mediums and movements.
            </span><br>
            <span class=“big”>
                <p>Sometimes art is not about the piece itself but the statement that it makes, thus creating something much larger than the work itself. Art can be a catalyst in society even if it "could have been made by anyone!" What is truly important is the fact that someone had the obscure idea and the courage to make the piece. I believe that we need artists such as Marcel Duchamp to rotate the urinals of the world, and artists such as John Cage to command orchestras to tacet.
